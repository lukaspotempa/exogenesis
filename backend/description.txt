# Colonies
- a colony has one home / start planet
- a colony starts with random resources
- each colony has a "residents" count, which indicates how many people live in that colony
- residents increase in dependency of the resources, not independently, so if we have a good atmosphere temperature and a lot of water, inhabitants will residents
- the fleets / ships and buildings which a colony can build are directly influced by the other resources
- each colony can take over other colonies/planets. If they take them over, the planet is then owned by the winner of the fight
- each planet has a main base, if the main base is destroyed, the destroying entity acquires ownership
- each colony can dispatch their own fleets for stuff
- colonies (main bases and cities) upgrade by inhabitants. A certain threshold of inhabitants/residents allows a small city, then metropolis etc

# Colony behavior
- colonies can have certain traits / politcal orientations. A colony can be: 
* pacifist, they do not attack nor fight back at all, they only build economical stuff, no fleets at all.
* aggresive, they tend to attack a lot, they tend to build a lot of fleets
* defensive, they don't initiate fights but fight back, they to build some fleets, but more defensive stuff and production buildings

# Colony resources
- colonies have resources, however the resources are not just "acquired"
- to acquire resources, colonies have to build production buildings
- for oil: refineries, for steel mines / quarrys
- to upgrade the base level they need to have certain amount of inhabitants, water, steel and oil (in storage), and a certain inhabitant cap
- once they reach a new base level, their base growth increases


# Ships and fleets
- ships are individual ships, fleets are the object that roams the world
- each fleet has hp and if it reaches 0, it is destroyed
- a fleet can only attack one target at a time
